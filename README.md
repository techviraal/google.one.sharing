I recently purchased a 100GB Google One Storage plan. In order to share the storage with my family, I created a family group and added my wife’s Google account to it assuming that she would be sharing the Google One storage that I had subscribed to. However my wife came back saying “Google says Your storage is almost full. If you run out of storage space, you won’t be able to upload files and photos, or send and receive an email”. I was like what the heck, what could be the problem? Well, just adding the member to the family sharing with Google account does not really allow storage sharing from Google One. Yes, it needs to be turned on and this article explains how to share Google One storage with your family, the right way.

## How to share Google One storage with your family?

Step 1:  Go to Google One page and click on “Invite family members” link in the “Add a family member” card.
Step 2: Create a family group by clicking the “CREATE FAMILY GROUP” button.
Step 3: On the Google families page, click on “Invite family member” and type a name or email address from the contacts. You can share up to six family members.
Step 4: The member you invited will receive a mail about the invitation and you will be notified once they accept the invitation. Remember, the invitation will expire automatically in two weeks’ time.
Step 5:  Go to Google One account and click on the Settings from the left side menu.
Step 6: On the right, look for the “Manage Family Settings” drop-down menu and click on it to see the “Share Google One with family” toggle button. Turn that on and you are done.


## What plans can be shared with my family?

Any paid Google One storage plan can be shared with your family. Whether that is the $1.99/month 100GB plan, or the $149/month 30TB plan, they can all be shared with your family. A good option to start would be the 200GB for $2.99/month or the 2TB for $9.99/month. As the 100GB plan might be too small if you are sharing with two or three other people (or more). As that would really only leave about 25-33GB per person, if everyone shared equally.

It’s good to see that Google is not limiting which plans can be shared with your family members. Many might think that this would only work on the 2TB and up plans. But that is not the case, thankfully. However, with the 2TB plan, you do get 10% back in store credit when you purchase from the Google Store. Which is nice to see. Especially if you are a Pixel or Nest user.
